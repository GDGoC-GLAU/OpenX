# Contributing to OpenX Workshop

Thank you for participating in the OpenX Git/GitHub Workshop! This guide will walk you through the contribution process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- A text editor of your choice

## Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Go to the [OpenX repository](https://github.com/GDGoC-GLAU/OpenX)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OpenX.git
cd OpenX
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 3: Create Your File

1. Create a new file named `firstname_lastname.txt` (use your actual name)
2. Add the following content (customize with your information):

```
Name: Your Full Name
GitHub Username: @yourusername
Favorite Programming Language: Python
Fun Fact: Something interesting about you!
```

### Step 4: Add and Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Add your file to the staging area
git add firstname_lastname.txt

# Commit your changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add firstname_lastname.txt - Workshop contribution"
```

### Step 5: Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request" button
3. Add a title like: "Add [Your Name] - Workshop Contribution"
4. Add a description explaining your contribution
5. Click "Create pull request"

## Git Commands Quick Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git clone <url>` | Clone a repository to your local machine |
| `git status` | Check the status of your working directory |
| `git add <file>` | Add file to staging area |
| `git add .` | Add all files to staging area |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Commit changes with a message |
| `git push origin main` | Push changes to remote repository |

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add file" not "Added file")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Be descriptive but concise

### File Naming
- Use lowercase letters
- Use underscores instead of spaces
- Follow the format: `firstname_lastname.txt`

### Content Guidelines
- Keep your content appropriate and professional
- Include accurate information
- Have fun with the "Fun Fact" section!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "Permission denied" when pushing
**Solution**: Make sure you're pushing to your fork, not the original repository

**Problem**: "File already exists" error
**Solution**: Make sure your filename is unique (use your actual name)

**Problem**: Merge conflicts
**Solution**: Ask for help during the workshop - we'll solve it together!
